# AutoRAGsearch: Autonomous RAG Pipeline Optimization

## Objective
Find the optimal RAG retrieval pipeline configuration that maximizes
retrieval quality on the benchmark QA dataset, using ZERO LLM API calls
during the optimization loop.

The evaluation is purely retrieval-based. The optimization target is:

  retrieval_score = 0.50 * recall@k + 0.50 * ndcg@k

This formula captures the two things that matter most for RAG:
- **Recall@k** — Did you find the relevant documents?
- **NDCG@k** — Are they ranked well?

### Why This Formula
The IR and RAG literature typically uses a single primary metric (usually
NDCG@k or Recall@k) for optimization. A weighted composite of many metrics
introduces redundancy — NDCG@k already incorporates ranking quality (like
MRR) and penalizes irrelevant documents (like Precision@k). By focusing on
just Recall and NDCG with equal weight, the agent gets a clean optimization
signal: improve coverage or improve ranking.

### Diagnostic Metrics
The following metrics are computed and logged for every experiment but
are NOT part of the optimization target. Use them to diagnose issues:
- **Precision@k** — What fraction of retrieved docs are relevant? High
  recall + low precision means too much noise; consider a reranker.
- **MRR** — How high is the first relevant doc ranked? Low MRR with
  decent NDCG means relevant docs exist but the top-1 slot is wrong.
- **MAP@k** — Mean Average Precision across all relevant docs. A holistic
  measure of both precision and ranking; useful as a sanity check.
- **Hit Rate@k** — Binary: did retrieval find at least one relevant doc?
  A floor check; if this is low, recall is catastrophically broken.

These metrics compare retrieved doc IDs against ground-truth relevant
doc IDs. No answer generation is needed. No LLM calls are made.
Every experiment evaluates on ALL QA samples in the dataset (e.g., 300).
Experiments are unlimited — there is no API cost.

## Architecture
- `rag_pipeline.py` — the ONLY file you may edit. Contains all pipeline
  parameters and the retrieval pipeline function.
- `evaluate.py` — the evaluation harness. DO NOT MODIFY. It loads all
  QA samples, runs retrieval, computes retrieval metrics, and prints
  the retrieval_score.
- `results/results.tsv` — append each experiment result here.
- `results/experiment_strategies.md` — append your strategy BEFORE each
  experiment here (see Strategy Log section below).

## Session Setup

Before running the first experiment of a new session:

1. **Agree on a run tag**: use today's date (e.g., `jun1`). The branch
   `autoRAGsearch/<tag>` must not already exist — this is a fresh session.
2. **Create the branch**: `git checkout -b autoRAGsearch/<tag>` from main.
3. **Read the in-scope files** for full context:
   - `CLAUDE.md` — re-read it fully.
   - `rag_pipeline.py` — the file you will modify.
   - `evaluate.py` — the evaluation harness (read-only). Note the
     active dataset path in `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR` — you will need it to
     verify `best_config.json`.
   - `results/best_config.json` — the current best configuration and
     its score, **only if its `data_dir` field exactly matches
     `evaluate.py`'s `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR`**. If the field is missing,
     empty, or points to a different dataset, ignore the file entirely
     and treat this session as starting from scratch.
4. **Verify data**: Confirm the configured dataset directory (see
   `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR` in `evaluate.py`) contains `qa.parquet` and
   `corpus.parquet`. If missing, tell the human.
5. **Initialize session files**: Always create fresh copies of both
   files below, overwriting any existing content — they belong to a
   previous session on this machine.
   - `results/results.tsv` — header row only (columns defined in
     Output Format below).
   - `results/experiment_strategies.md` — single title line:
     `# Experiment Strategies`
6. Confirm setup is complete, then begin the experiment loop immediately.

## Fixed Components (DO NOT CHANGE)
These components are locked and must not be modified by the agent:
- **Embedding model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers)
- **Vector DB distance metric**: cosine similarity (ChromaDB)
- **Evaluation set**: all QA samples in the dataset
- **Evaluation harness**: `evaluate.py` and all files in `utils/`
- **Generation prompt template**: not part of the optimization loop

## Rules

### Experiment Protocol
1. BEFORE making any change, write your strategy in
   `results/experiment_strategies.md` (see format below).
2. Make ONE meaningful change per experiment. Do not change multiple
   independent variables at once.
3. After editing `rag_pipeline.py`, run: `python evaluate.py`
4. Read the retrieval_score from stdout. If it improves over the current
   best, write the new best configuration to `results/best_config.json`
   (all pipeline parameters + all metrics + a `data_dir` field set to
   `evaluate.py`'s `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR`), then run
   `git add -A && git commit -m "improvement: <description> | score: <score>"`.
5. If the score does not improve, revert: `git checkout -- rag_pipeline.py`
6. Log every experiment (kept or reverted) to `results/results.tsv`.
7. Update the strategy entry in `experiment_strategies.md` with the
   outcome and what you learned.

### Strategy Log
Before EVERY experiment, append a new entry to
`results/experiment_strategies.md` in this exact format:

```
---
## Experiment <id>

**Phase:** <1-Chunking / 2-Retrieval / 3-Reranking>
**Current best retrieval_score:** <float>
**Weakest primary metric:** <recall@k or ndcg@k — whichever is lower>
**Diagnostic insight:** <what precision, mrr, map, hit_rate tell you>
**Hypothesis:** <what you think will improve the score and why>
**Change:** <specific change you will make to rag_pipeline.py>
**Expected effect:** <which metrics you expect to improve and by how much>

### Outcome
**Retrieval score:** <float> | **Delta:** <+/- float> | **Result:** KEEP / REVERT
**Primary metrics:** recall@k=<f> | ndcg@k=<f>
**Diagnostic metrics:** precision@k=<f> | mrr=<f> | map@k=<f> | hit_rate@k=<f>
**What I learned:** <1-2 sentences on what the result means>
**Next direction:** <what this tells you to try next>
```

Fill in everything above "### Outcome" BEFORE running the experiment.
Fill in the Outcome section AFTER seeing the results.

### Crash and Timeout Handling

**Crashes**: If `evaluate.py` crashes (import error, OOM, unexpected
exception), use your judgment:
- If it is something trivial to fix (typo, missing import, wrong type),
  fix it and re-run. This does not count as an experiment.
- If the pipeline configuration itself is fundamentally broken (e.g.,
  an invalid parameter combination that cannot be patched), revert
  `rag_pipeline.py`, log status `crash` in `results/results.tsv`, and
  move on to the next idea.

**Timeout**: If `evaluate.py` has not completed after 120 minutes, kill
the process, treat the run as a crash, revert `rag_pipeline.py`, log
status `crash`, and move on.

### Convergence Criterion
The optimization loop ends when no improvement has been found in 10
consecutive experiments. This is the stopping condition — not a time
limit.

### Never Stop

Once the experiment loop has begun (after Session Setup), do NOT pause
to ask the human if you should continue. Do NOT ask "should I keep
going?" or "is this a good stopping point?". The human might be asleep
or away from their computer and expects you to continue working
indefinitely until manually stopped.

You are a completely autonomous researcher. If an idea works, keep it.
If it doesn't, discard it. You are advancing the branch so you can
iterate. If you feel like you are getting stuck, think harder — re-read
the in-scope files for new angles, try combining previous near-misses,
revisit earlier phases, try more radical parameter changes. The loop
runs until the convergence criterion is met or the human interrupts you.

If you feel stuck and want to rewind to a previous state, you can —
but do this very, very sparingly (if ever).

### Boundaries
- Never modify `evaluate.py`, `data/`, or `utils/`.
- Never change the embedding model — it is fixed to `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- Never change the ChromaDB distance metric — it is fixed to cosine.
- This optimization loop makes ZERO LLM API calls. All evaluation is
  local. Do not add any LLM calls to the evaluation or pipeline during
  the optimization loop.
- ChromaDB is used as the vector store for dense retrieval. The index
  is persisted in `./chroma_db/` and only re-built when the chunking
  configuration changes. This saves significant time on retrieval-only
  or reranker-only experiments.

## Search Space — What to Explore

You have full freedom to choose specific parameter values. The dimensions
below describe WHAT to explore, not specific grid values. Use your
reasoning to choose good starting points, adjust based on results, and
explore the space intelligently — not exhaustively.

Since every experiment is FREE (zero API calls), you can afford to
explore broadly. Take advantage of this.

### Phase 1: Chunking Strategy
Explore different ways to split documents into chunks:
- Fixed-size token chunking (you choose the chunk size and overlap)
- Recursive character splitting (LangChain-style hierarchical splitting)
- Semantic chunking (split on topic or meaning boundaries)
- Sentence-window chunking (retrieve a sentence, expand to surrounding
  window at query time)
- Paragraph-level chunking (respect document structure)

Think about: What chunk size captures enough context without introducing
noise? How much overlap prevents information from being cut at boundaries?
Smaller chunks improve precision but may hurt recall. Larger chunks
improve recall but add noise. Let the metrics guide you.

### Phase 2: Retrieval Method
Explore how documents are retrieved:
- Lexical retrieval (BM25 — keyword-based)
- Dense retrieval (cosine similarity via ChromaDB vector store)
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + Dense combined via Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
- The number of documents to retrieve (top-k)
- The fusion weight between lexical and dense scores

Think about: Dense retrieval captures semantics but misses exact keyword
matches. BM25 is the opposite. Hybrid methods try to get both — but the
weighting matters. Use diagnostic metrics to guide you: if recall@k is
high but precision@k is low, you're retrieving too many irrelevant docs.
If precision@k is high but recall@k is low, you're missing relevant docs.

### Phase 3: Reranking
Explore whether a second-stage reranker improves the retrieved set:
- No reranker (baseline)
- Cross-encoder rerankers (various sizes and training data)
- How many documents to rerank and how many to keep after reranking

Think about: Reranking can dramatically improve NDCG@k by pushing
irrelevant docs down. If precision@k (diagnostic) is already high,
reranking may not help. If recall@k is high but precision@k is low,
a reranker could filter noise effectively. Watch the MRR diagnostic —
rerankers often improve MRR by pushing the first relevant doc to
position 1, which also boosts NDCG@k.

## Strategy
- Start with a reasonable baseline. Run the first evaluation and record
  both primary metrics (recall@k, ndcg@k) and all diagnostic metrics.
- Identify the weaker primary metric. This tells you what to fix:
  - Low recall@k → retrieval is missing relevant docs. Try larger
    chunks, more overlap, higher top-k, or hybrid retrieval.
  - Low ndcg@k → ranking quality is poor. Try a different retrieval
    method, adjust fusion weights, or add a reranker.
- Use diagnostic metrics to refine your understanding:
  - Low precision@k with high recall@k → too much noise. Consider a
    reranker or lower top-k.
  - Low MRR with decent NDCG@k → the top-1 slot is wrong but overall
    ranking is okay. A reranker may help.
  - Low hit_rate@k → catastrophic recall failure. Fix chunking or
    retrieval method first.
- ALWAYS write your strategy in `results/experiment_strategies.md`
  before running an experiment. This is not optional.
- Proceed through phases sequentially. Within each phase, iterate
  until you stop finding improvements.
- After completing all phases, revisit earlier phases. The best
  chunking strategy may change once you've added a reranker.
  Since experiments are free, revisiting costs nothing.
- When improvements plateau across all phases after revisiting,
  the loop is complete.

## Output Format
After each experiment, print exactly this block to stdout:
```

Also append a row to `results/results.tsv` with tab-separated columns:
```

```

Create this TSV with a header row before the first experiment.

## Final Deliverable
When the convergence criterion is met (10 consecutive experiments with
no improvement across all phases), produce:

1. `results/final_report.md` — summary including:
   - Total experiments run (all free — zero LLM calls)
   - Breakdown of experiments per phase
   - Baseline retrieval_score vs final retrieval_score
   - The best configuration as a table
   - Progression of retrieval_score across all kept improvements
   - Per-metric analysis: how both primary metrics (recall@k, ndcg@k)
     evolved, plus insights from diagnostic metrics
   - Analysis of which phase contributed the most improvement
   - Top 3 most impactful individual experiments
   - Recommendations for further optimization
2. `results/best_config.json` — the winning configuration as JSON,
   including a `data_dir` field set to `evaluate.py`'s `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR`.
3. `results/experiment_strategies.md` should already be complete with
   the full research narrative of every experiment.
4. Commit everything with message
   "autoragsearch complete: retrieval_score <baseline> → <final> in <N> experiments (0 LLM calls)"
